			<h2>FlexiLexi Postcard</h2>
			
				<p>For this piece I had to create a postcard for an online health blog called <em>FlexiLexi</em>. I brought the designs from the website into the post card by recreating some of the graphics. I decided to do this so that in looking at the postcard you can recognize the website.</p>

			<h2>Poster Design</h2>
			
				<p>Software: Illustrator</p>
				
				<p>I had to create a poster for the <em>Algonquin Theatre Program</em> for their final grad show. The poster had to be designed around the theme of being Canadian and had to include specific text and logos. I used red as the main colour in the design because red is a very Canadian colour. To add some interest to the design there is a person riding a moose holding up a microphone as if celebrating victory.</p>

			<h2>World Wildlife Fund Booklet</h2>
			
				<p>Software: InDesign</p>
			
				<p>The goal of this assignment was to create an 8 page informational booklet for the <em>World Wildlife Fund</em>. To create the booklet I came up with a colour scheme of blue and purple, which was carried throughout the booklet in the images and sub-headers. This booklet has a three-column layout, which helps the text flow nicely.</p>

			<h2>The Robber Bridegroom Layout</h2>
			
				<p>Software: Illustrator, InDesign, Human Hands (hand drawn, edited in Photoshop) and Photoshop</p>
			
				<p>This short story layout was all about creating an illustrative tittle that represents the Grim story, <em>The Robber Bridegroom,</em> relying for the most part on type, not imagery.</p>

			<h2>Eye</h2>
			
				<p>Software: Canon Camera, Photoshop</p>
			
				<p>This is a macro image of an eye. This image is the product of an open subject photo shoot. For this image I needed to have the lens focused perfectly, with the correct lighting to capture all of the detail in the iris.</p>

			<h2>IPhone Case Design</h2>
					
				<p>Software: Photoshop</p>
					
				<p>The goal of this design was to create an appealing IPhone cover design that could be used throughout the IPhone, into the lock screen. The theme I chose to use for the design was the four natural elements fire, water, earth and air. Inspiration for the symbols was taken from the anime series, <em>The Last Airbender</em>.</p>

			<h2>Book Cover Re-Design</h2>
			
				<p>This is a book cover re-design from a book called <em>Thieves Till We Die</em>. The goal was to create an appealing book cover with appropriate typographic hierarchy. I went with a simple design and colour scheme of black, white and red. The symbols on the cover such as the matrix code, the sword and the red water with the water droplet all are representative of the story. The cover is uncluttered with lots of white space to create a simple but intriguing design.</p>
